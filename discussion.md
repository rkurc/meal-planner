# Discussion & Clarifications

This file contains questions from Jules, the AI software engineer, to clarify the task requirements.

## Initial Questions

1.  **Regarding the `.ai` directory:** You mentioned creating an `.ai` catalog. Should I create a directory named `.ai` at the root of the repository for the output files? Also, do you have a preferred naming convention for the files I'll be creating in this directory (e.g., `01_feature_summary.md`, `02_requirements.md`, etc.)?

2.  **Regarding the end goal:** The overall task is to "stabilize the code." My current instructions focus on analysis and planning. Is the ultimate goal for me to later implement the tests from the test plan and fix any discovered issues, or is this task purely about generating these analysis documents?

3.  **Regarding the feature summary:** When I summarize features from the `Readme.md` files, are you looking for a high-level bulleted list, or would you prefer a more detailed description for each feature? If there are multiple `Readme.md` files, should I treat the one in the root directory as the primary source?
