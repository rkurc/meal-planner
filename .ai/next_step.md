The Meal Plan Management UI has been tested, and a critical bug has been fixed.

**Work Completed:**
- Thoroughly tested the API endpoints for the Meal Plan Management UI (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Identified and fixed a bug where the `description` field for meal plans was not being created, updated, or returned correctly by the API.
- The fix was implemented across the data model, CRUD layer, and API layer.
- The fix has been verified, and all code quality checks (linting and formatting) are passing.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Enhance API and Testing**

The immediate priority is to improve the robustness of the application by enhancing the API and adding automated tests.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Add End-to-End Tests:** Create end-to-end tests for the Meal Plan Management UI to automate the testing process and prevent future regressions. This was suggested in a previous `next_step.md`.
2.  **Enhance Recipe API:** The recipe creation is currently only available via a traditional form submission. To improve the consistency of the API, a JSON API endpoint for creating recipes (`POST /api/recipes`) should be added.
3.  **Continue UI Development:** Continue to build out the React UI to cover all features of the application, such as recipe creation and editing, which are currently only available through Jinja2 templates.
