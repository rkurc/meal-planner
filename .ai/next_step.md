The project's Docker, Dev Container, and CI infrastructure have been completely overhauled to improve the development and deployment experience.

**Work Completed:**
- **Production `Dockerfile`:** Created a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for building a lean, secure production image with Gunicorn.
- **Development Container:** Created a dedicated `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json` to provide a fully-configured, one-click development environment in VS Code.
- **CI Workflow:** Added a new GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`) that builds the dev container and runs a full suite of tests (backend, frontend build, E2E).
- **Documentation:** Rewrote the main `README.md` to reflect the new container-based workflows.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Verify CI and Fix Failing Tests**

The new `integration-tests.yml` workflow has been implemented but has not yet been run successfully. The immediate priority is to trigger this workflow, analyze its results, and fix any remaining test failures. This will validate the new development and CI setup.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Run and Debug CI Workflow:** Trigger the `integration-tests.yml` workflow (e.g., by pushing a small change to a new branch and opening a PR).
2.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully read the logs from the workflow run to identify why the tests are failing. The previous session indicated potential issues with `pytest` discovery and the E2E test networking.
3.  **Implement Fixes:** Apply the necessary fixes to the code or workflow configuration until all tests pass in CI.
