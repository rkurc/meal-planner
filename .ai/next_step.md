The development environment has been successfully repaired, and the Meal Plan Management UI is now testable.

The following work was completed:
- The frontend Vite server was fixed by resolving issues with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configuration.
- The backend Flask server was debugged and fixed to ensure all API routes are correctly registered and served.
- The UI for the Meal Plan List was visually verified and is rendering correctly.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Test the Meal Plan Management UI**

The immediate priority is to thoroughly test the new Meal Plan Management UI to ensure it is fully functional and free of bugs.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Thoroughly test the new Meal Plan Management UI.** This includes:
    - Creating new meal plans.
    - Editing existing meal plans.
    - Viewing meal plan details.
    - Deleting meal plans.
2.  **Fix any bugs found during testing.**
3.  **Consider adding end-to-end tests** for the new UI to prevent future regressions.
