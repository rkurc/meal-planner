A JSON API endpoint for creating recipes has been added to improve API consistency.

**Work Completed:**
-   **Enhanced Recipe API:** Added a `POST /api/recipes` JSON endpoint for creating recipes. This brings the Recipe API in line with the Meal Plan API.
-   The new endpoint is covered by automated tests.
-   All code quality checks (linting and formatting) are passing.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Enhance API and Testing**

The immediate priority is to improve the robustness of the application by enhancing the API and adding automated tests.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Add End-to-End Tests:** Create end-to-end tests for the Meal Plan Management UI to automate the testing process and prevent future regressions. This was suggested in a previous `next_step.md`.
2.  **Continue UI Development:** Continue to build out the React UI to cover all features of the application, such as recipe creation and editing, which are currently only available through Jinja2 templates.
