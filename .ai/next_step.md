The Meal Plan Management UI has been implemented in the React frontend. This includes the following components:
- `MealPlanList.jsx`: Displays a list of all meal plans.
- `MealPlanDetail.jsx`: Shows the details of a single meal plan.
- `MealPlanForm.jsx`: A form for creating and editing meal plans.

Routing has been set up in `App.jsx` to handle the new views.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Fix the Development Environment**

The new UI components are **completely untested** because the frontend development server could not be started due to persistent issues with the PostCSS and Tailwind CSS configuration. The immediate priority must be to create a stable and working development environment so that the new features can be tested and verified.

**Next Implementation Steps (after environment is fixed):**
1.  Thoroughly test the new Meal Plan Management UI.
2.  Fix any bugs found during testing.
3.  Consider adding end-to-end tests for the new UI to prevent future regressions.
