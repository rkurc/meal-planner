**Work Completed:**
- Set up Playwright for end-to-end (e2e) testing of the frontend application.
- Added the necessary dependencies (`@playwright/test`) and configuration (`playwright.config.js`).
- Created a new npm script (`test`) to run the tests.
- Added an initial test file (`e2e/main.spec.js`) with two tests:
  - One to check the homepage title.
  - One to verify the initial state of the "Recipes" page when no recipes are present.
- Updated the `index.html` title to "Meal Planner" to match the test expectation.
- Ensured all backend and frontend code quality checks pass.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Seed the Database for E2E Testing**

The e2e tests are now running, but the `RecipeList` component currently shows "No recipes found." because the database is empty. This limits the scope of the e2e tests. The immediate priority is to seed the database with some initial data.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Seed the Database:** Create a script or a manual process to add some initial recipes to the database. This will allow for more comprehensive e2e tests.
2.  **Expand E2E Tests:** Once the database is seeded, update the e2e test for the recipes page to check for the presence of actual recipe items, rather than the "No recipes found." message.
3.  **Continue Feature Development:** With a solid testing foundation in place, continue with the development of new features.
