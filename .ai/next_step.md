Comprehensive setup instructions have been added to the main README.md.

**Work Completed:**
- **Added Documentation:** A new "Getting Started (Manual Setup)" section has been added to the main `README.md`. This section provides detailed instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application and its tests without relying on the Dev Container.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Enhance API and Testing**

The immediate priority is to improve the robustness of the application by enhancing the API and adding automated tests.

**Next Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Add End-to-End Tests:** Create end-to-end tests for the Meal Plan Management UI to automate the testing process and prevent future regressions. This was suggested in a previous `next_step.md`.
2.  **Continue UI Development:** Continue to build out the React UI to cover all features of the application, such as recipe creation and editing, which are currently only available through Jinja2 templates.
