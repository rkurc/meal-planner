# Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the features currently implemented in the Meal Planner application and outlines the work that remains to be done, based on the project's requirements and migration plan.

## 1. Current Implemented Features

The application is partially functional, with a mix of backend APIs, a traditional server-rendered UI (Jinja2), and a modern UI (React).

### Backend & API

*   **Recipe API (`/api/recipes`):** A functional JSON API endpoint exists for fetching all recipes. This is used by the React frontend.
*   **Meal Plan API (`/api/meal-plans`):** A full suite of CRUD endpoints for managing meal plans.
*   **Shopping List API (`/api/shopping-lists`):** A full suite of CRUD endpoints for managing persistent shopping lists.
*   **Database Models:** In-memory `dataclass` models are in place for `Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `MealPlan`, and `ShoppingList`.
*   **CRUD Logic:** Business logic for all CRUD operations exists in `meal_planner_app/crud.py`.

### Traditional UI (Jinja2 Templates)

The following features are fully implemented and accessible via the server-rendered Jinja2 templates:

*   **Recipe Management:** Full CRUD functionality for recipes. Users can add, view, edit, and delete recipes.
*   **Meal Plan Management:** Full CRUD functionality for meal plans. Users can create plans, add existing recipes to them, view, and delete them.
*   **Shopping List Generation:** Users can generate a shopping list from an existing meal plan. The list consolidates ingredients.

### Modern UI (React @ `/ui/`)

*   **Recipe Display:** A basic React single-page application (SPA) is in place that can fetch and display a list of recipes from the `/api/recipes` endpoint.
*   **Build System:** A modern Vite-based build system is configured for the React application.

## 2. Remaining Work & Future Features

The following is a list of features and tasks that are either partially implemented or not yet started. The overall goal is to complete the migration to a headless Flask API and a full-featured React SPA.

### High-Priority Tasks (Migration & API)

1.  **Expand API Coverage (Backend):**
    *   **Meal Plans:** Create full CRUD API endpoints (`/api/meal-plans`). Currently, meal plans are only manageable via the Jinja2 templates.
    *   **Shopping Lists:** Create API endpoints for generating and managing shopping lists (`/api/shopping-lists`).
    *   **API Authentication:** Implement a robust authentication system (e.g., JWT) for the API to secure it for frontend consumption.

2.  **Achieve Feature Parity (Frontend):**
    *   **Meal Plan Management:** Rebuild the meal plan management interface in React, using the new API endpoints.
    *   **Shopping List Management:** Rebuild the shopping list generation and editing interface in React.
    *   **Recipe Management:** Implement create, update, and delete functionality for recipes in the React UI (currently it is read-only).

3.  **Testing:**
    *   **API Tests:** Write comprehensive integration tests for all API endpoints (recipes, meal plans, shopping lists) to ensure they are reliable.
    *   **E2E Tests:** Write end-to-end tests for all major user workflows (e.g., creating a recipe, building a meal plan, generating a list) in the new React application to prevent regressions.

### New Features (Post-Migration)

1.  **Automatic Recipe Discovery:**
    *   **URL-Based Extraction:** Implement the service that takes a URL, scrapes the web page, and uses an AI/NLP model to extract ingredients and instructions, pre-filling the "Add Recipe" form.
    *   **Search-Based Discovery:** Implement a feature to search the web for recipes based on user queries and allow importing them.

2.  **Advanced Functionality:**
    *   **PDF Export:** Add the ability to export meal plans and shopping lists to PDF.
    *   **Advanced Recipe Search:** Implement a powerful local search/filter capability within the React UI.

### Final Cleanup (Post-Migration)

*   **Decommission Legacy UI:** Once all features have been migrated to and verified in the React SPA, the old Jinja2 templates and the Flask routes that render them should be removed.
